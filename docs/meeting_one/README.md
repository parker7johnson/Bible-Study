# The Core of the Gospel
## The main message we want to spread to the world
---

1. Jesus is the Son of God who lived a sinless life.
    - prophecied by Isaiah 53
    - Hebrews 4:15 "...has been tempted in everyway as we are, yet without sin."
    - 1 John 3:5 "...and there is no sin in him."
2. Jesus died on the cross for our sins and was Resurrected
    - Witnessed by thousands for 40 days following this resurrection
    - Jesus did truly die on the cross
3. Salvation by Grace through faith
    - John 3:16 "...that who ever believes in him..."
    - Ephesians 2:8-9 "...by grace through faith..."
    - Works cannot gain you salvation (James 2 :14 - 20)
    - Works are a byproduct of true faith
4. The Great Commission
    - Go make desciples of all nations
    - Teach them to observe everything I have commanded you

When should we start talking about Jesus after we meet someone?
